Arya alias Bhashyam
The Youth who hoisted the national flag at Chennai fort in 1932
On January 25th, 1932 in the streets of Triplicane Arya Bhashyam enquired in each and every textile shop, "Do you have stock of Indian national flag?".
Many of them said, 'No'. Some of them secretly showed him a small sized national flag. But that was not what Arya Bhashyam wanted. He needed a huge flag.
He designed a national flag all by himself. Arya Bhashyam purchased a four yards dhoti and dipped it in water soaked with colours of saffron, blue and green. 
In the middle of the flag he drew a spinning wheel and wrote, "From today India will breathe the air of freedom". After the flag got dried he folded and wrapped it around his waist.
He bought a ticket and entered Elphinstone theatre in Mount road, Madras. After the film ended when the audience came out Arya Bhashyam moved along with them. 
The police patrol at Fort Saint George also dispersed. None noticed him as he was in Khaki uniform.
He walked towards the 200 feet high flagpole near the fort. He climbed up to 140 feet easily as it was accessible by foot. 
The rest 60 feet was nothing but an iron pipe. Slowly and steadily and step by step Arya Bhashyam reached the top. He removed the flag around his waist and hoisted it on the flagpole.
The next morning there was a commotion among the officers of Fort Saint George. All the dignitaries assembled near the fort flagpole.
As if nothing had happened, Arya alias Bhashyam was walking in Thambu chetty street near Madras high court.
Jawaharlal Nehru wanted the country to celebrate republic day on January 26th in 1932. To implement Nehru's vision, Arya Bhashyam hoisted the national flag. At that time he was 25 years old.
