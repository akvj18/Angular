Arya alias Bhashyam
The Youth who hoisted the national flag at Chennai fort in 1932
On January 25th, 1932 in the streets of Triplicane Arya Bhashyam enquired in each and every textile shop, "Do you have stock of Indian national flag?".
Many of them said, 'No'. Some of them secretly showed him a small sized national flag. But that was not what Arya Bhashyam wanted. He needed a huge flag.
He designed a national flag all by himself. Arya Bhashyam purchased a four yards dhoti and dipped it in water soaked with colours of saffron, blue and green. 
In the middle of the flag he drew a spinning wheel and wrote, "From today India will breathe the air of freedom". After the flag got dried he folded and wrapped it around his waist.
He bought a ticket and entered Elphinstone theatre in Mount road, Madras. After the film ended when the audience came out Arya Bhashyam moved along with them. 
The police patrol at Fort Saint George also dispersed. None noticed him as he was in Khaki uniform.
He walked towards the 200 feet high flagpole near the fort. He climbed up to 140 feet easily as it was accessible by foot. 
The rest 60 feet was nothing but an iron pipe. Slowly and steadily and step by step Arya Bhashyam reached the top. He removed the flag around his waist and hoisted it on the flagpole.
The next morning there was a commotion among the officers of Fort Saint George. All the dignitaries assembled near the fort flagpole.
As if nothing had happened, Arya alias Bhashyam was walking in Thambu chetty street near Madras high court.
Jawaharlal Nehru wanted the country to celebrate republic day on January 26th in 1932. To implement Nehru's vision, Arya Bhashyam hoisted the national flag. At that time he was 25 years old.

8/3/2023--------------------------------------------Maveeran Madasamy

He was involved in collector Ashe’s
murder case

In the Ashe Durai murder case, Maveeran Madasamy was one
of the accused. He composed and sang songs to inspire people
to seek freedom. The worker at Coral Mills in Thoothukudi toiled
day and night for meagre wages and increased the income of the
management.

Madasamy raised slogans condemning the British for not
adequately compensating the workers. During the protest he
provided food and motivated the starving workers. Ashe who had
been promoted as Collector of Tirunelveli district, was active in
suppressing those with Swadeshi views.

He ordered that no one should hold processions or stage
sermons for the freedom struggle. And in public meetings, he
collected information with the secret police to find out exactly who
was speaking against the British. The speeches and movements of
some were observed in their homes by the secret police, whom he
considered as home-grown terrorists.

An uncertainty gripped among the patriots. As per collector Ashe’s
directive four civilians died on the spot in police firing. Shocked to
see that, Madasamy went to Sengottai and met Vanchinathan there.
They roped in youngsters from Sengottai, Tirunelveli and surrounding
areas and formed an organization called “Bharatmata Association”.

They took a vow before the Lord that, “I pledge to Parashakti and
Bharata Mata to eradicate the British who enslave and rule our holy
Bharath”.

At Maniyachi railway station, Collector Ash was shot dead by
Vanchinathan himsetf. Madasamy was actively sought by the police
for his alleged involvement in the conspiracy. He disappeared
undetected by anyone, till his last days the police were never able
to find him.------------------------------------------------------
8/4/2023--------------------------------------------------The freedom fighter who coined,
“Jai Hind’

Born on September 15, 1891 in Thiruvananthapuram
to Chinnaswamy Pillai and Nagammal. In September 1914,
Chenbagaraman Pillai founded the ‘Intemational Pro-india
Committee’ in Zurich and was the chairman of the committee.
During the same time, he saw the urge of the Indian revolutionaries
abroad to achieve freedom.

Chenbagaraman Pillai was one of the freedom fighters who
wished to join hands with the common enemy to drive away the
British from his homeland and organise an armed attack from
outside. He influenced the Germans to such an extent that they were
forced to trust him.

Chenbagaraman was instrumental in directing the German ship,
‘Emden’ which attacked the British ships at Madras on the night
of 22nd September, 1914. Many places were damaged including
an oil depot. This incident shook the Britishers and announced a
reward of one lakh pounds to anyone who successfully captured
Chenbagaraman and handed him to them.

Itwas Chenbagaraman who gave India and Indians living in India
and abroad fighting for the country’s independence the slogan, “Jai
Hind".

Chenbagaraman met Lakshmi Bai a native of Manipur in Berlin
and got married in 1931. When Adolf Hitler started assuming that
Indians were incapable of ruling themselves, Chenbagaraman stood
against Hitler, and forced him to give a written apology. As a result,
he became a victim to the Nazis who killed him by food poisoning on
May 26th, 1934, at the age of 42.
